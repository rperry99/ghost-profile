            This was from a battlefield in Pennsylvania. There were a lot of

            I also captured this photo of some figures in the treeline. I could
            not find anything that would have made these shapes.

            I got to visit the historic Ghettysburg battlefield in Pennsylvania.
            It has been known to have some spirits. I went with a group of
            people from my college and got to take a private tour of the field.
            <br /><br />
            On the tour, I was able to capture this image on the tree line. It
            appears there is a some sort of apparition in the bottom left of the
            screen. It almost looks like you can make out a human figure.

            This was from a trip out to California. My group was in a manor out
            in the Hills and we were able to capture this apparition in a
            window. It looks like it's a girl with her hand out. There were no
            girls with our group that night. I am not sure how this can be
            explained.

            <a>@brandonpontoha</a> came out to our log cabin in the woods. He

            captured a few photos of some mysterious things.

            though!

            I never used to believe in ghosts. I just thought people were crazy.
            <a>@brandonpontoha</a> let me join him and his group on his
            investigation. We heard someone say "Help me" in the basement of my
            shop. Super spooky.
