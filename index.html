            This was from a battlefield in Pennsylvania. There were a lot of
            strange noises going on while I was there. <br />
            I also captured this photo of some figures in the treeline. I could
            not find anything that would have made these shapes.

            This was something I captured in a window in a mansion in the Hills
            of California. It looks like there is a girl looking through the
            other side of the window.
